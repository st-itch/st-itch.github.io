	    Every day at school, we had to write a diary of what we did at home. <br>
	    <br>
	    I wrote that in Jamaica <br>
	    we lived in trees <br>
	    and ran around with <br>
	    whatever they told us we wore<br>
	    and I even drew pictures. <br>
	    <br>
	    I think it got to the stage where <br>
	    I wasn't sure what was true anymore, <br>
	    the pictures they were showing me <br>
	    or the memories I had in my head.
