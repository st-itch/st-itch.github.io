	    At the beginning of my first playtime at school, one of the more friendly white<br>
	    girls led me into the playground, where all the others crowded around me. Two<br>
	    boys started to back me<br>
	    ‘Blackie’<br>
	    and<br>
	    ‘golliwog’.<br><br>
	    This made me very upset. I remember taking my beret off my head and holding it<br>
	    up to my face and saying,<br>
	    ‘Look, I’m not Black, this is!”<br><br>
	    When I told the teacher she just said,<br>
	    ‘Take no notice.’<br><br>
	    This sounded useless to me.<br>
	    How come I not take any notice?
