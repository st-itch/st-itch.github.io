	    By what miracle I escaped marriage I do not know, for all my life long I fell in love.<br>
	    <br>
	    But, on the whole, I am glad. <br>
	    <br>
	    I do not doubt that I lost much, but I am quite sure I gained more. <br>
	    <br>
	    Marriage, <br>
	    for a woman at least, <br>
	    hampers two things that made life to me glorious <br>
	    - friendship and learning. <br>
	    <br>
	    In man it was always the friend, not the husband, that I wanted. <br>
	    <br>
	    Family life has never attracted me. <br>
	    At its best it seems to me rather narrow and selfish; <br>
	    at its worst, <br>
	    a private hell. <br>
	    <br>
	    The role of wife and mother is no easy one; <br>
	    with my head full of other things<br>
	    I might have <br>
	    dismally failed.‚Äù
