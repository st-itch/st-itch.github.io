	    I remember being constantly asking by the teachers and the children where I came from, <br>
	    <br>
	    what was it like, <br>
	    did I live in a house or a tree, <br>
	    did we wear clothes, <br>
	    did we speak English? <br>
	    <br>
	    You begin to feel so different, you feel uncomfortable, and because you are so young you don't know how to deal with it. <br>
	    <br>
	    The way I dealt with it was I decided I wasn't going to fight it. <br>
	    I gave in to whatever they said.
