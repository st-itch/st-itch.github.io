	    My mother had brought me to Girton on the first day and we were
	    shown round by an old student. The building was still in its
	    infancy, and the only public room was the dining-hall; but I was
	    impressed by it and by the long corridors, the ‘gyps’ wing, the
	    wide stone stairs with their shallow rises. <br>
	    <br>
	    When the door of my study was opened and I saw my own fire, my own
	    desk, my own easy chair and reading lamp – nay even my own kettle –
	    I was speechless with delight. <br>
	    <br>
	    Imagine my dismay when my mother turned to me with open arms and
	    tears in her eyes, saying<br>
	    <br>
	    ‘You can come home with me again, Nell, if you like!’
