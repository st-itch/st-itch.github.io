	    I remember my early school days as being a very unhappy time.
	    People were watching you all the time, and if you did anything it
	    wasn't because you were you, but because you were Black. There was
	    a time when this teacher pulled me up in front of the class and
	    said I was dirty and that she was going to make sure that my neck
	    was cleaned â€“ and she proceeded to do it, with Vim. My father is
	    usually a quiet man, but he went up there with a machete.
